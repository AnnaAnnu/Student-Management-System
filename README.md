# Student-Management-System
We create a new register by combining data from two classes while making some modifications to the register.
Then, Create a 'class_1' list and pass the elements 'Geoffrey Hinton','Andrew Ng','Sebastian Raschka','Yoshua Bengio'.
and create a 'class_2' list and pass the elements 'Hilary Mason','Carla Gentry','Corinna Cortes'. Now ,concatenate the 'class_1' and 'class_2' list 
and store the values in a'new_class' variable.
We Printed the 'new_class' variable to see the new list.

The students list was visible.

Now,
We added a student whose name is Peter Warden and we added him in the new register.
So, to do this we added new element 'Peter Warden' in the 'new_class' list and to see the updated list we printed the 'new_class' .

For wrong entry in the list whose name is Carla Gentry. We are going remove her from the register. we remove her from the 'new_class' list and updated our list 
and print that updated list.

Now, we create a dictionary  named 'courses' for Geoffrey Hinton in each subject to generate his progress report.
The keys and values are:
course	marks
Math	65
English	70
History	80
French	70
Science	60
and we print the marks obtained in each subject ,add all the marks scored out of 100 and store it in a variable named 'total'.Print 'total'and we will 
calculate the 'percentage' scored by 'Geoffrey Hinton' where addition of all the subjects is 500 and Print the 'percentage'.

:::::::::::::::::::The calculated value of total should be 345 and that of percentage should be 69.0:::::::::::::


Now, For the student who got the highest marks in this subject, we need to check who performed best in mathematics from all the students 
who appeared for the test.

Create a dictionary named 'mathematics' using the keys and values given :
student	marks
Geoffrey Hinton	78
Andrew Ng	95
Sebastian Raschka	65
Yoshua Benjio	50
Hilary Mason	70
Corinna Cortes	66
Peter Warden	75


Here we will find out the student with the highest marks in Mathematics and store it in a variable 'topper'.
The value stored in topper should be 'Andrew Ng'.

Now from the previous task, we came to know who is the 'Maths' topper in the class and we will print the name of the student on the certificate, and we 
have to print his last name and then his first name.

String name 'topper' with the Math topper's name is given.
and we split the 'topper' using the "split()" function and stored the results in 'first_name' and 'last_name'.


Now, we have to display the full name concatenating + the strings 'last_name' and 'first_name' strings we add a whitespace character between them to
avoid displaying them together and store it in a full_name variable and convert all the elements in the 'full_name'string to uppercase,
and store it to the 'certificate_name' variable.

Finally,
Print 'certificate_name'.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
certificate_name is 'NG ANDREW'.
